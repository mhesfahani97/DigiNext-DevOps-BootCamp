# Task 1: VMs and Networks Adventures 🏰

Welcome to Task 1's kingdom of VMs and Networks magic! In this folder, we've got two subfolders that will take us on an adventure through VMs and Networks.

## Subfolders Overview 📂

### VM_Learning 📚

### VM_Task 🎯

1. Use any kind of virtualization that you desire.
Create a “host-only” network.  
2. Create any kind of network which has Internet access through an interface of your host.  
3. To test the access to another network:  
 - Create a VM with 2 interfaces; one to access internet and another as host-only = Machine A.
 - Create another VM with host-only network = Machine B.
 - Grant internet access from A to B.
4. Create a VPN server or Proxy server:
This VPN or proxy server MUST be usable through cli for package managers like apt or yum. 


## How to Use 🛠️

1. Start by exploring the Learning subfolders.

2. Once you feel confident in your knowledge, venture into the Task subfolders. Get your hands dirty with real-world tasks and challenges.

Now, let's set up your virtual machine and network for a journey towards glory! 🌐🏹
