# Task 4: Kubernetes Adventures 🏰

Welcome to Task 4's kingdom of Kubernetes magic! In this folder, we've got two subfolders that will take us on an adventure through Kubernetes.

## Subfolders Overview 📂

### Kubernetes_Learning 📚

create a cluster by Kubeadm and Calico network, and deploy an image for hobby!

### Kubernetes_Task 🎯

This week our task is extremely simple: use the below repository and provided guidelines to set up a K8S cluster:
[repository](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way).  
The task itself is simple, yes but doing it is hard; hence “the hard way” in the repository name :)  
Try to absorb as much information as possible on how these services are being set up.  
**Hint 1:** This guideline is based on GCP; you have to change any related part to adapt it accordingly. Search a little bit and use the “bare-metal” keyword; use this result just as a guideline and refer to our own link to do the task.  
**Hint 2:** Don’t try to fully understand what’s going on; try to understand as much as possible only about the cluster and deliver the task in the exact time frame.

## How to Use 🛠️l

1. Start by exploring the Learning subfolders.

2. Once you feel confident in your knowledge, venture into the Task subfolders. Get your hands dirty with real-world tasks and challenges.

3. Don't forget to check out the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/mhesfahani97/DigiNext-DevOps-BootCamp/wiki) for detailed explanations, step-by-step guides.

Now, grab your Kubernetes clusters and let's orchestrate our way to glory! 🌐🏹
