# Task 3: HAProxy, SQL, NoSQL Adventures 🏰

Welcome to Task 3's kingdom of HAProxy, SQL and NoSQL magic! In this folder, we've got six subfolders that will take us on an adventure through HAProxy, SQL and NoSQL.

## Subfolders Overview 📂

### HAProxy_Learning 📚

1. Create 3 Nginx containers.
2. Configure all Nginx containers equaly and serve a static page on each of them.
3. Specify an instance-specific content on each node, enableing you to diffrentative which one you’re accessing.
4. Create a forth Ubuntu container and install HAproxy on it.
5. Configure the HAproxy to respond on the localhost URL and balance the load among those Nginx containers.

### HAProxy_Task 🎯

1. Create 3 VMs & install Nginx on each of them.
2. Configure all Nginx instances equally and serve a static page on each one.
3. Specify an instance-specific content on each node, allowing you to determine which one you are accessing.
4. Create a forth VM and install HAproxy on it.
5. Configure the HAproxy to respond on a specific URL and balance the load among the Nginx instances.
6. Reconfigure the HAproxy to respond on the same URL but with 3 different path, each connecting to a seprate Nginx instances.
