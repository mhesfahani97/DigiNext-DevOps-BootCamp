# Task

This project demonstrates how to set up a WordPress blog using Docker Compose and ensure data persistence to prevent data loss during container restarts.

## Nginx Configurations
In the "Nginx" folder, you'll find three Nginx configuration files that I've learned while working on this task. These configurations are designed to enhance the performance and security of the web server.

## Local Deployment
The "local" folder contains my solution for the task, which is configured to run on a local host, such as my laptop. It includes all the necessary files and instructions to launch the WordPress blog, ensuring a seamless experience for users accessing the blog locally.

Feel free to explore the contents of each folder to learn more about the configurations and deployment process.
