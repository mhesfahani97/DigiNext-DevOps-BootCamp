# Task 4: Kubernetes_2 Adventures 🏰

Welcome to Task 5's kingdom of kubernetes_2 magic! In this folder, we've got two subfolders that will take us on an adventure through kubernetes_2.

## Subfolders Overview 📂

### kubernetes_2_Learning 📚


### kubernetes_2_Task 🎯

1. Optional but highly recommended:
 - It’s a good idea to setup a K8S cluster in a production manner. To do so, I recommend using kubeadm but you can do however you like according to K8S documentation:
 - [production-environment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/)
 - [production-environment-tools](hhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/)
2. Optional:
 - Setup a reverse proxy and host everything that we will create from this point forward, behind it.
3. Main:
 - Setup a private registry with authentication for docker.
 - Create a namespace called “wordpress”.
 - Setup our own wordpress site on your K8S cluster and expose it to outside.
 - Restart & update wordpress to see what will happen.
